# ðŸŒŠ Flow

![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a06c71-4f1b-4375-969a-77f8d30b1fb5)

Flow is an [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) color scheme written in
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It features carefully designed colors to help
focusing during coding plus fluorescent details to provide a vibrant environment.

Why fluo? Because it's cool!

## Palette

Flow has been designed using a palette based on 9 colors selected through the HSL representation to
create a cohesive ambiance. The principal color is the light blue, and the additional colors have
been chosen as follows with minor changes have a more pleasant looking:

- **Analogous** (S+/-30): blue, cyan.

- **Complementary** (S+/-180): orange.

- **Tetradic** 60 (S+/-60): purple, green.

- **Split comp** (S+/-150): yellow, red.

Furthermore, sky blue has been included to enhance the blue tones, and a fluorescent color has been
added for striking accents.

## Requirements

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) >=
  [0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

## Installation

Install the theme with your preferred package manager, such as
[folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  tag = "v1.0.0",
  opts = {
        -- Your configuration options here.
    },
}
```

Please, set the tag field if you don't want to automatically update the colorscheme introducing
breaking changes.

## Usage

### Lua

To install and start using the plugin with default options:

```lua
require("flow").setup{}
vim.cmd "colorscheme flow"
```

## Configuration

The following section describes as how to configure the plugin using Lazy plugin manager.

### Default

The configuration allows you to specify 5 different options:

```lua
return {
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  tag = "v1.0.0",
    opts = {
      dark_theme = true, -- true | false
      transparent = true, -- true | false
      high_contrast = false, -- true | false
      fluo_color = "pink", -- "pink" | "cyan" | "yellow" | "green" | "orange"
      mode = "default", -- "default" | "bright" | "dark"
      aggressive_spell = false, -- true | false
    },
    config = function(_, opts)
      require("flow").setup(opts)
      vim.cmd("colorscheme flow")
    end,
  },
}
```

Keep in mind that the `transparent` flags set the background of neovim transparent and, as a
result, the terminal emulator background will be visible. It is suggested to always add some bluur
to the terminal emulator when the background is transparent.

## Extras

Flow.nvim provides colorschemes also for the following tools:

- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) at [tmux-flow.conf](./extra/tmux-flow.conf).

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) at [alacritty-flow.toml](./extra/alacritty-flow.toml).
