# ðŸŒŠ Flow

![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4a06c71-4f1b-4375-969a-77f8d30b1fb5)

Flow is an [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) color scheme written in
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It features a carefully curated palette to enhance
focus during coding, complemented by fluorescent accents for a vibrant and dynamic look.

Why fluo? Because it's simply cool!

## Palette

Flow uses a palette of nine HSL-based colors, chosen to create a cohesive and visually appealing
environment. The primary color is light blue, with supporting tones selected as follows based on
the saturation value:

- **Analogous** (Â±30Â°): blue, cyan.

- **Complementary** (Â±180Â°): orange.

- **Tetradic** 60 (Â±60Â°): purple, green.

- **Split comp** (Â±150Â°): yellow, red.

Additionally, sky blue enhances the blue tones, and a fluorescent color provides striking accents.

## Requirements

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) >=
  [0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

## Installation

Install Flow with your preferred package manager, such as
[folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  tag = "vX.0.0",
  opts = {
        -- Your configuration options here.
    },
}
```

> Use the tag field to prevent breaking changes from automatic updates.

## Usage

### Lua

Setup and start using Flow with default options:

```lua
require("flow").setup{}
vim.cmd "colorscheme flow"
```

## Configuration

The following section describes how to configure the plugin using Lazy plugin manager.

### Default

```lua
return {
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  tag = "v1.0.0",
    opts = {
      theme = {
        style = "dark", --  "dark" | "light"
        contrast = "default", -- "default" | "high"
        transparent = false, -- true | false
      },
      colors = {
        mode = "default", -- "default" | "dark" | "light"
        fluo = "pink", -- "pink" | "cyan" | "yellow" | "orange" | "green"
        custom = {
          saturation = "", -- "" | string representing an integer between 0 and 100
          light = "", -- "" | string representing an integer between 0 and 100
        },
      },
      ui = {
        borders = "inverse", -- "theme" | "inverse" | "fluo" | "none"
        aggressive_spell = false, -- true | false
      },
    },
    config = function(_, opts)
      require("flow").setup(opts)
      vim.cmd("colorscheme flow")
    end,
  },
}
```

Keep in mind that the `transparent` flag sets the background of neovim transparent and, as a
result, the terminal emulator background will be visible. It is suggested to always add some bluur
to the terminal emulator when the background is transparent.

## Extras

Flow.nvim provides colorschemes also for the following tools:

- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) at [tmux-flow.conf](./extra/eclipse/tmux-flow-pink.conf).

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) at [alacritty-flow.toml](./extra/eclipse/alacritty-flow-pink.toml).

- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) at [kitty-flow.conf](./extra/eclipse/kitty-flow-pink.conf).

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) at [fzf-flow.sh](./extra/eclipse/fzf-flow-pink.sh).

- [ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) at [ghostty-flow.config](./extra/eclipse/ghostty-flow-pink.config).

To generate extra themes you can use the `Makefile`:

```sh
make extras
```

Now you can copy generated files at `./extras/` where your configuration is sourcing them.
