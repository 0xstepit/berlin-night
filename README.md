# ðŸŒŠ Flow

![logo](./assets/flow-logo.png) 

Flow is an [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) color scheme written in
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It features carefully designed colors to help
focusing during coding plus fluorescent details to provide a vibrant environment.
Why fluo? Because it's cool!

# Palette

Flow has been designed using a palette based on 9 colors selected through the HSL representation to
create a cohesive ambiance. The principal color is the light blue, and the additional colors have been chosen
as follows:

- **Analogous** (S+/-30): blue, cyan.

- **Complementary** (S+/-180): orange.

- **Tetradic** 60 (S+/-60): purple, green.

- **Split comp** (S+/-150): yellow, red.

Furthermore, sky blue has been included to enhance the blue tones, and a fluorescent color has been added for
striking accents. 

![flow-palette](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c7b90f0-f128-4c7c-849c-a7ab876339c8)

The palette is defined across four different levels of light and saturation of
base color to provide different choices of based on the user preferences:

|               |Base|Bright|Dark|Desaturate|
|---------------|----|------|----|----------|
|**Light**      |X   |75    |25  |X         |
|**Saturation** |80  |80    |50  |50        |

Where X is equal to 70 if the dark theme is selected, or 30 if it is light. Flow allows a lot of
customizability in terms of background, main colors, and fluo, but from a big design space come 
big responsibilities! It is up to you to create a good atmosphere and an harmonic environment. In
the short future, I will create pre-defined configurations, but for the moment please, just try to
follow these guidelines:

- When you set a transparent background, use a dark desktop image with the dark theme and a light one
with the light theme.

- Do not use the dark mode with the dark theme, and, consequently, don't use bright mode with the
light theme.

# Requirements

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) >=
  [0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

## Installation

Install the theme with your preferred package manager, such as
[folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  opts = {},
}
```

# Usage

## Lua

```lua
require("flow").setup{}
vim.cmd "colorscheme flow"
```

# Configuration

## Default

The configuration allows to specify 5 different options:

```lua 
return {
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  opts = {},
  config = function()
    require("flow").setup{
      dark_theme = true, -- Set the theme with dark background.
      high_contrast = false, -- Make the dark background darker or the light background lighter.
      transparent = false, -- Set transparent background.
      fluo_color = "pink", -- Color used as fluo. Available values are pink, yellow, orange, or green.
      mode = "base", -- Mode of the colors. Available values are: dark, bright, desaturate, or base.
      aggressive_spell = false, -- Use colors for spell check.
    }

    vim.cmd "colorscheme flow"
  end,
}
```

# Extras

Flow.nvim provides colorschemes also for the following tools:

- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) at [tmux-flow.conf](./extra/tmux-flow.conf).

- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) at [alacritty-flow.toml](./extra/alacritty-flow.toml).

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) at [fzf-flow.sh](./extra/fzf-flow.sh).

The generation of extra is not automatic (I'm sorry, I'm working on it). If you want
to generate the color scheme for extras, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Change the config used for the extra theme generation in `lua/flow/extra/main.lua` without
setting the background transparent.

2. Generate the themes:

```sh
cd ./lua/flow/extra
lua main.lua -v
```

Now you copy the files in where your configuration is sourcing them.

# Todo

This is still an ongoing project. Below are the next topics I will work on:

- [ ] Add docs.

- [ ] Extra automatic generation.

- [ ] Create predefined configurations of the theme.

If you want to contribute to this project, please consider addressing one of the
previous point :)
