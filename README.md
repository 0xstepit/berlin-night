# ðŸŒŠ Flow

![logo](./assets/flow-logo.png) 

Flow is an [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) color scheme designed for transparent or dark backgrounds. It features
carefully designed colors to help focusing during coding plus fluorescent details to provide a vibrant environment. Why fluo? Because it is
cool!

# Palette

Flow has been designed using a palette based on nine colors selected through the HSL representation to
create a cohesive ambiance. The principal color is light blue, and the additional colors have been chosen
as follows:

- **Analogous** (S+/-30): blue, cyan.

- **Complementary** (S+/-180): orange.

- **Tetradic** 60 (S+/-60): purple, green.

- **Slit comp** (S+/-150): yellow, red.

Furthermore, teal has been included to enhance the blue tones, and a fluorescent color has been added for
striking accents. The palette is defined across three different levels of light:

|Bright|Normal|Dim|
|-|-|-|
|80|70|30|

      transparent = false, -- Set transparent background.
      fluo_color = "pink", --  Fluo color: pink, yellow, orange, or green.
      mode = "normal", -- Intensity of the palette: normal, bright, desaturate, or dark. Notice that dark is ugly!
