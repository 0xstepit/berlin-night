# ðŸŒŠ Flow

![logo](./assets/flow-logo.png) 

Flow is an [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) color scheme written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It features
carefully designed colors to help focusing during coding plus fluorescent details to provide a vibrant environment. Why fluo? Because it is
cool!

# Palette

Flow has been designed using a palette based on 9 colors selected through the HSL representation to
create a cohesive ambiance. The principal color is the light blue, and the additional colors have been chosen
as follows:

- **Analogous** (S+/-30): blue, cyan.

- **Complementary** (S+/-180): orange.

- **Tetradic** 60 (S+/-60): purple, green.

- **Slit comp** (S+/-150): yellow, red.

Furthermore, teal has been included to enhance the blue tones, and a fluorescent color has been added for
striking accents. The palette is defined across three different levels of light:

|Bright|Normal|Dim|
|-|-|-|
|80|70|30|

  [0.8.0](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

## Installation

Install the theme with your preferred package manager, such as
[folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  opts = {},

# Configuration

## Default

The configuration allows to specify 5 different options:

```lua 
return {
  "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  opts = {},
  config = function()
    require("flow").setup{
      light_theme = false, -- Set the theme with white background.
      transparent = false, -- Set transparent background.
      fluo_color = "pink", -- Color used as fluo. Available values are pink, yellow, orange, or green.
      mode = "base", -- Mode of the colors. Available values are: dark, bright, desaturate, or base.

# Todo

This is still an ongoing project. Below are the next topics I will work on:

- [ ] Add docs.

- [ ] Extra automatic generation.

- [ ] Create predefined configurations of the theme.

If you want to contribute to this project, please consider addressing one of the
previous point :)
