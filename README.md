# üåä Flow

![logo](./assets/flow-logo.png) 

Flow is an [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) color scheme designed for transparent or dark backgrounds. It features
carefully designed colors to help focusing during coding plus fluorescent details to provide a vibrant environment. Why fluo? Because it is
cool!

## Palette

Flow has been designed to use a palette based on 9 colors selected on the HSL representation. The principal color is the light blue, and the
other colors has been chosen in the following way:

- **Analogous** (S+/-30): blue, cyan.
- **Complementary** (S+/-180): orange.
- **Tetradic** 60 (S+/-60): purple, green.
- **Slit comp** (S+/-150): yellow, red.

To these colors it has been added the teal to provide a more bluish palette and the fluo one. The palette is defined with 3 different level of light:

|Bright|Normal|Dim|
|-|-|-|
|L=80|L=70|L=30|
