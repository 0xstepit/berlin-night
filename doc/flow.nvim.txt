1. ðŸŒŠ Flow                                             *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow*

Flow is an Nvim <https://github.com/neovim/neovim> color scheme written in Lua
<https://www.lua.org/>. It features a carefully curated palette to enhance
focus during coding, complemented by fluorescent accents for a vibrant and
dynamic look.

Why fluo? Because itâ€™s simply cool!


SHOWCASE                                        *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-showcase*


PALETTE                                          *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-palette*

Flow uses a palette of nine HSL-based colors, chosen to create a cohesive and
visually appealing environment. The primary color is light blue, with
supporting tones selected as follows based on the saturation value:

- **Analogous** (Â±30Â°): blue, cyan.
- **Complementary** (Â±180Â°): orange.
- **Tetradic** 60 (Â±60Â°): purple, green.
- **Split comp** (Â±150Â°): yellow, red.

Additionally, sky blue enhances the blue tones, and a fluorescent color
provides striking accents.


REQUIREMENTS                                *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-requirements*

- Neovim <https://github.com/neovim/neovim> >=
    0.8.0 <https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.8.0>


INSTALLATION                                *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-installation*

Install Flow with your preferred package manager, such as folke/lazy.nvim
<https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>:

>lua
    {
      "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
      lazy = false,
      priority = 1000,
      tag = "vX.0.0",
      opts = {
            -- Your configuration options here.
        },
    }
<


  Use the tag field to prevent breaking changes from automatic updates.

USAGE                                              *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-usage*


LUA ~

    vim.cmd "colorscheme flow"
<


CONFIGURATION                              *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-configuration*

The following section describes how to configure the plugin using Lazy plugin
manager.


DEFAULT ~

>lua
    return {
      "0xstepit/flow.nvim",
      lazy = false,
      priority = 1000,
      tag = "v2.0.1",
        opts = {
          theme = {
            style = "dark", --  "dark" | "light"
            contrast = "default", -- "default" | "high"
            transparent = false, -- true | false
          },
          colors = {
            mode = "default", -- "default" | "dark" | "light"
            fluo = "pink", -- "pink" | "cyan" | "yellow" | "orange" | "green"
            custom = {
              saturation = "", -- "" | string representing an integer between 0 and 100
              light = "", -- "" | string representing an integer between 0 and 100
            },
          },
          ui = {
            borders = "inverse", -- "theme" | "inverse" | "fluo" | "none"
            aggressive_spell = false, -- true | false
          },
        },
        config = function(_, opts)
          require("flow").setup(opts)
          vim.cmd("colorscheme flow")
        end,
      },
    }
<

Keep in mind that the `transparent` flag sets the background of neovim
transparent and, as a result, the terminal emulator background will be visible.
It is suggested to always add some bluur to the terminal emulator when the
background is transparent.

EXTRAS                                            *flow.nvim-ðŸŒŠ-flow-extras*

Flow.nvim provides colorschemes also for the following tools:

- Tmux <https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki> at tmux-flow.conf
    <./extra/eclipse/tmux-flow-pink.conf>.
- Alacritty <https://alacritty.org/> at alacritty-flow.toml
    <./extra/eclipse/alacritty-flow-pink.toml>.
- Kitty <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/> at kitty-flow.conf
    <./extra/eclipse/kitty-flow-pink.conf>.
- fzf <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf> at fzf-flow.sh
    <./extra/eclipse/fzf-flow-pink.sh>.
- ghostty <https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty> at ghostty-flow.config
    <./extra/eclipse/ghostty-flow-pink.config>.

To generate extra themes you can use the `Makefile`:

>sh
    make extras
<

Now you can copy generated files at `./extras/` where your configuration is
sourcing them.
